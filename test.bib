  abstract  = {Cyclodextrins (CDs) have been investigated as potential biopolymeric carriers that can form inclusion complexes with numerous bioactive ingredients. The inclusion of micronutrients (e.g. vitamins or minerals) into cyclodextrins can enhance their solubility and provide oxidative or thermal stability. It also enables the formulation of products with extended shelf-life. The designed delivery systems with CDs and their inclusion complexes including electrospun nanofibers, emulsions, liposomes, and hydrogels, show potential in enhancing the solubility and oxidative stability of micronutrients while enabling their controlled and sustained release in applications including food packaging, fortified foods and dietary supplements. Nano or micrometer-sized delivery systems capable of controlling burst release and permeation, or moderating skin hydration have been reported, which can facilitate the formulation of several personal and skin care products for topical or transdermal delivery of micronutrients. This review highlights recent developments in the application of CDs for the delivery of micronutrients, i.e. vitamins, iron, and iodine, which play key roles in the human body, emphasizing their existing and potential applications in the food, pharmaceuticals, and cosmeceuticals industries.

  abstract  = {Background Genetic selection improves a population by increasing the frequency of favorable alleles. Understanding and monitoring allele frequency changes is, therefore, important to obtain more insight into the long-term effects of selection. This study aimed to investigate changes in allele frequencies and in results of genome-wide association studies (GWAS), and how those two are related to each other. This was studied in two maternal pig lines where selection was based on a broad selection index. Genotypes and phenotypes were available from 2015 to 2021. Results Several large changes in allele frequencies over the years were observed in both lines. The largest allele frequency changes were not larger than expected under drift based on gene dropping simulations, but the average allele frequency change was larger with selection. Moreover, several significant regions were found in the GWAS for the traits under selection, but those regions did not overlap with regions with larger allele frequency changes. No significant GWAS regions were found for the selection index in both lines, which included multiple traits, indicating that the index is affected by many loci of small effect. Additionally, many significant regions showed pleiotropic, and often antagonistic, associations with other traits under selection. This reduces the selection pressure on those regions, which can explain why those regions are still segregating, although the traits have been under selection for several generations. Across the years, only small changes in Manhattan plots were found, indicating that the genetic architecture was reasonably constant. Conclusions No significant GWAS regions were found for any of the traits under selection among the regions with the largest changes in allele frequency, and the correlation between significance level of marker associations and changes in allele frequency over one generation was close to zero for all traits. Moreover, the largest changes in allele frequency could be explained by drift and were not necessarily a result of selection. This is probably because selection acted on a broad index for which no significant GWAS regions were found. Our results show that selecting on a broad index spreads the selection pressure across the genome, thereby limiting allele frequency changes.},

A gradual decrease in the shear viscosities and a greater shear thinning behavior were observed with increasing PEB content due to its low molecular weight, which acted as a lubricant or plasticizer, favoring the disentanglement of PBS chains. The blends with higher PEB content (25 and 30 wt%) had higher activation energy values and were more sensitive to temperature variations. The morphology showed good dispersion of PEB in the PBS matrix. Still, increased PEB content led to larger droplets, indicating immiscibility and poor adhesion between phases. PEB influenced both nucleation density and spherulite size of PBS/PEB blends, denoted by an increasing degree of crystallinity, a shift to low crystallization temperatures, and an improvement in the decomposition temperature according to their thermal properties. Low PEB contents (5 and 10%) increased PBS toughness due to the higher crystalline fraction and smaller crystal size of these blends.},
