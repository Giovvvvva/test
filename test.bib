  abstract  = {Purpose of Review Millions of people now use generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) tools in their daily lives for a variety of purposes, including sexual ones. This narrative literature review provides the first scoping overview of current research on generative AI use in the context of sexual health and behaviors. Recent Findings The review includes 88 peer-reviewed English language publications from 2020 to 2024 that report on 106 studies and address four main areas of AI use in sexual health and behaviors among the general population: (1) People use AI tools such as ChatGPT to obtain sexual information and education. We identified k  = 14 publications that evaluated the quality of AI-generated sexual health information. They found high accuracy and completeness. (2) People use AI tools such as ChatGPT and dedicated counseling/therapy chatbots to solve their sexual and relationship problems. We identified k  = 16 publications providing empirical results on therapists’ and clients’ perspectives and AI tools’ therapeutic capabilities with mixed but overall promising results. (3) People use AI tools such as companion and adult chatbots (e.g., Replika) to experience sexual and romantic intimacy. We identified k  = 22 publications in this area that confirm sexual and romantic gratifications of AI conversational agents, but also point to risks such as emotional dependence. (4) People use image- and video-generating AI tools to produce pornography with different sexual and non-sexual motivations. We found k  = 36 studies on AI pornography that primarily address the production, uses, and consequences of – as well as the countermeasures against – non-consensual deepfake pornography. This sort of content predominantly victimizes women and girls whose faces are swapped into pornographic material and circulated without their consent. Research on ethical AI pornography is largely missing. Summary Generative AI tools present new risks and opportunities for human sexuality and sexual health. More research is needed to better understand the intersection of GenAI and sexuality in order to a) help people navigate their sexual GenAI experiences, b) guide sex educators, counselors, and therapists on how to address and incorporate AI tools into their professional work, c) advise AI developers on how to design tools that avoid harm, d) enlighten policymakers on how to regulate AI for the sake of sexual health, and e) inform journalists and knowledge workers on how to report about AI and sexuality in an evidence-based manner.},

  abstract  = {Urbanization is one of the most abrupt mechanisms of land use change. This process can generate significant impacts on biodiversity, and its effects on bat activity patterns need further exploration due to the importance of these animals in controlling insect populations and maintaining ecological balance. This study aims to evaluate and describe the activity patterns of insectivorous bats in the Brazilian Cerrado, using environmental variables such as moon phase (full and new), season (dry and wet), and the level of urbanization. The level of urbanization was defined through an urbanization index and then classified into urban, suburban, and natural habitats to elucidate the impacts of this process on biological communities. We used ultrasonic recorders to sample insectivorous bats and count passes to measure activity in the study areas. A decrease in the activity of aerial insectivorous bat assemblages in the Cerrado was observed with decreasing urbanization. Additionally, bats exhibited higher activity during dry seasons and lower activity during full moon periods, suggesting lunar phobia. We identified significant effects of the time of night and the season of the year on the detectability of these bats, with a higher probability of detection in the first half of the night and during the dry season. Understanding these patterns in urban areas is crucial in the context of expanding cities. This knowledge aids in the maintenance and protection of insectivorous bat species that are fundamental to the balance of ecosystems and the provision of essential ecosystem services in both urban and natural areas of the Cerrado.},

  abstract  = {Drone photography is an essential building block of intelligent transportation, enabling wide-ranging monitoring, precise positioning, and rapid transmission. However, the high computational cost of transformer-based methods in object detection tasks hinders real-time result transmission in drone target detection applications. Therefore, we propose mask adaptive transformer (MAT) tailored for such scenarios. Specifically, we introduce a structure that supports collaborative token sparsification in support windows, enhancing fault tolerance and reducing computational overhead. This structure comprises two modules: a binary mask strategy and adaptive window self-attention (A-WSA). The binary mask strategy focuses on significant objects in various complex scenes. The A-WSA mechanism is employed to self-attend for balance performance and computational cost to select objects and isolate all contextual leakage. Extensive experiments on the challenging CarPK and VisDrone datasets demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of the proposed method. Specifically, it achieves a mean average precision ( mAP @0.5) improvement of 1.25% over car detector based on you only look once version 5 (CD-YOLOv5) on the CarPK dataset and a 3.75% average precision ( AP @0.5) improvement over cascaded zoom-in detector (CZ Det) on the VisDrone dataset.},
