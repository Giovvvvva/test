- Our commit convention:
- - "Add exercise 1.1.1", "Change Function for exercise 1.2." etc.
- - Convention is important here! Use caps for the first word, always imperative, never past tense.
- - And optional: Try to commit on every change and not on every whole Exercise sheet, it simplifies correction and rollbacks.
- - See examples on how to do and to don't xD
